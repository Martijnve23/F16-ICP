## 3D Printing
The main body consists of four parts. This is done in order to optimize printing orientation, support usage and print quality. All of the parts can be printed using a normal FDM 3D printer.  
The parts are aligned using a small segment of 1.75 mm filament and glued together using superglue or something similar. ([See assembly section](assembly.md))  
It is also possible to print the whole body in one part. It will just require some support and the surfaces might require more sanding depending on your print quality.  
To prevent keywobble, the tolerances for the keys are a bit tight. If they are too tight or too big with your printer, please scale the keycaps or edit the original CAD.  
  
All STL's and original FreeCAD models can be found in XXX.  
  
There is also a set with the text engraved in the keycaps. **These are WIP**. It is easiest to print them on their sides so the text is aligned with the Z-axis. I have not yet gotten them to a quality I am happy with using this way. I used a laser engraver because it's make this a lot easier :).
