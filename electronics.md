# ASSEMBLY ORDER MATTERS!!!
It is mostly important if you plan on soldering the Blue Pill in place without headers. With headers to order is less important.  
With that out of the way, let's get on with assembling the PCB.
* Solder in all diodes (Align the stripe on the diode with the stripe on the PCB)
* Solder in the **3** and **RCL** switches
* Solder in the (headers for the) Blue Pill
* Solder the 10k Column PullUp resistors
* Solder in the rest of the switches
* Extend the rocker switch legs using the cutoffs of the resistor legs
* Solder in the Dobber and rocker switches
* Solder wires to the toggle switch connections
* \[**Optional**\] Solder in the 27 ohm USB resistors and solder in a USB cable

**Please note:** The position of the switches is important. Depending on how small the clearances are with main body, they are a bit finicky.  
Solder them in as straight and centered as possible. After attaching it to the main body, play around with placement by heating up the solder joints of the switches and moving the switch a bit to get it to align correctly.
